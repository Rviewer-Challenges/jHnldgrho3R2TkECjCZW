Considerations:

First consideration is how to handle conversions?


Another thing is, if providing a web interface, how do we handle the conversion? To keep the logic
centered, we use only the back-end and then the front-end must do an AJAX call to get value.
Again, this is pretty overkill as the usual conversion would be straight; however, second though
drives us to get again to the Cº/Fº conversion. So we need to compute a formula, and thus decide
if duplicating logic or centralising it somewhere. The conclusion is to keep it in the backend, so all
clients can access the service, and so will do the front-end.

Also added db.sqlite3 to have a test/demo database with some units already loaded and an admin
user created to make it easier to test. User 'admin', pass 'Test1234$'.
